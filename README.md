# Petition Generator

This is a simple library to store (and generate, in future) petitions.

## Installation

TODO: Describe the installation process

## Usage

Basically, a petition needs to be created, and then it can be signed by people.
A petition can be owned by a `Person`, or by an `Organization`. All these classes implements `Issuer` interface. An `Issuer` can be a `Person` or an `Organization`.
If yu have a different application that needs another type of `Issuer`, you can implement the `Issuer` interface.  

> *Tip*: `Issuer` interface has a single method, `getComplateName()` that returns the complete name of the issuer. For `Person` it returns the name and surname (and middle name if exists), and for `Organization` it returns the name of the organization and type (Shelby Ltd.).
