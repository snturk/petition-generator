The Board of Directors nominates candidates for election using various criteria including applicants’ past record of involvement with the GBCFC, commitment to cooperative principles, understanding of the co-op’s purpose and goals, and the expertise they can bring to the board. We strive to choose nominees who best meet the needs of the co-op and to give member- owners a choice of excellent candidates in each annual election. The board’s nominees are announced to the membership at least 90 days before the election. Member-owners who applied to be candidates but were not selected as nominees by the board may run for election independently by filing this petition. All candidates must be current member-owners of the co- op.
To be placed on the ballot, complete this form, collect the required signatures from at least 25 other member-owners, and mail this petition to the address below along with a photo and your campaign statement (500 words or less) at least 60 days before the election.
