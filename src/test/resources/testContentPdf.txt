Dear fellow open-source enthusiasts,
<br><br>
We are gathered here today to address a critical issue that has plagued our community for far too long. We need to stop the madness and bring some much-needed sanity to our projects.
<br>
We are, of course, referring to the use of Comic Sans in our code.
<br>
Yes, we know it's a funny font, and it brings a smile to your face. But let's be honest, it's not very professional. It's time to say goodbye to the days of code looking like a grade-schooler's art project.
<br>
We hereby petition all open-source projects to ban Comic Sans from their codebases. We suggest that projects adopt a strict policy of using only professional-looking fonts, such as Times New Roman or Arial.
<br>
Let's take our coding seriously and show the world that we mean business. Say no to Comic Sans and yes to professionalism!
